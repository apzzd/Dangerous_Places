### Why are sidewalks a big deal?

A little over a year ago, Johnson City announced that it was working towards being recognized as a UNICEF Child Friendly City. Then, a year ago, they began to remodel the old Model Mill building, which is within walking distance of the park and outdoor farmers market, using millions of dollars to convert it into office space and small shops. And then, just a few months ago, Crumb Bakeshop opened in a cute little building right next to the renovated Model Mill.

And the most surprising thing: the Johnson City government will pay remote workers $5,000 to move here.

I'm very happy that Johnson City is improving its downtown area, and I think it's wonderful that they are working towards becoming a Child Friendly City. But wouldn't it be even better if the walking conditions improved, especially with neighborhoods and parks nearby?

### Why can't people use cars?

Of course they can use cars! But some people (like me) want to walk. Also, I have been to the new bakery and seen people walk up to it from the surrounding neighborhoods, so I know I'm not the only one.

Don't you think it would be more fun to walk to the bakery and then go spend time outside in the park than drive?

### Ok, but are there really that many unsafe sidewalks?

Time to get out the map.

[map sidecar, show all data points]

Yes, there aren't only a few, and I didn't take photos of places all over whole city. These are just the places within walking distance of my house.

And look here! There are a bunch of places near the new bakery! So if a mom or dad in the surrounding neighborhoods walks up with a stroller, they might have a problem walking here.

[zoom back out to scrollable map with all data points]

There's only about 30 data points here, but I would like to say that I walked to these places myself collect this data. You can explore here, and check out some places.

With all that activity near Model Mill and Crumb Bakeshop, it would be so much better if the sidewalks around them were improved and the intersections were fixed, so that it would be easier and more fun to walk around the city.
