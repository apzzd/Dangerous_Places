### Why are sidewalks a big deal?

A little over a year ago, Johnson City announced that it was working towards being recognized as a UNICEF Child Friendly City. Then, a year ago, they began to remodel the old Model Mill building, which is within walking distance of the park and outdoor farmers market, using millions of dollars to convert it into office space and small shops. And then, just a few months ago, Crumb Bakeshop opened in a cute little building right next to the renovated Model Mill.

And the most surprising thing: the Johnson City government will pay remote workers $5,000 to move here.

I'm very happy that Johnson City is improving its downtown area, and I think it's wonderful that they are working towards becoming a Child Friendly City. But wouldn't it be even better if the walking conditions improved, especially with neighborhoods and parks nearby?

### Who cares?

Well, I can think of four different types of people that could benefit from fixing the sidewalks:
 - people in wheelchairs
 - old people
 - parents with children in strollers
 - college students without cars

 If we added more ramps, that would be very helpful for old people who can't step up onto a curb, parents pushing strollers, and people in wheelchairs. College students without cars would benefit from all kinds of improvements on sidewalks and crosswalks, because they either have to walk everywhere or take a bus.

### What is there to walk to, anyway?

Well, there are actually quite a few places to go to within walking distance of the apartment buildings and neighborhoods. Let's get out the map!

Feel free to explore here. There's a lot to visit, yeah?

[show layer with dangerous places on top of interesting places]

The only problem is all of the unsafe sidewalks and intersections between them.

For example, if you were to walk from Monarch College Living to Crumb Bakeshop, you would come across [number] places where it's hard to walk.

Speaking of Crumb Bakeshop, check out of of the problems with the sidewalk here!

With all that activity near Model Mill and Crumb Bakeshop, it would be so much better if the sidewalks around them were improved and the intersections were fixed, so that it would be easier and more fun to walk around the city.
