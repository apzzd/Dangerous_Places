Why are sidewalks a big deal?

A little over a year ago, Johnson City announced that it was working towards being recognized as a UNICEF Child Friendly City. Then, a year ago, they began to remodel the old Model Mill building, which is within walking distance of the park and farmers market, using millions of dollars to convert it into office space and small shops. And then, just a few months ago, Crumb Bakery opened in a cute little building right next to the renovated Model Mill.
And the most surprising thing: the Johnson City government will pay remote workers $5,000 to move here.
So I'm wondering, why go though all this trouble, if you can't even find enough money - or time - to fix your sidewalks and crosswalks?


Why can't people use cars?

Well, they can use cars! But some people (like me) walk. And I have been to the new bakery and seen people walk up to it from the surrounding neighborhoods.
And what's the point of sidewalks if they're not safe? Why did you even put them there? If they're not safe for people to walk on, it was a waste of time and money.


Alright, but if there are only three places where the sidewalk is unsafe, wouldn't it be a waste to fix it?

Yeah, but there aren't only three.

And look here! There are a bunch of places near the new bakery!
